# Employee Directory

This app was made to replicate what an employee directory would look like for a given company. In this iteration, i used walmart as an example for styling purposes. The app has full CRUD applications and it's main purpose is for employers to have reference to all their employees/their info as well as see who is on staff and be able to check whether they are currently understaffed, sufficiently staffed, or overstaffed. As for employeees themselves, they are able to clock in/ clock out. Employers have capabilities to add new employees, delete employees (upon firing), update employee info (salary for example). All forms have restricted input and error handling for invalid input.

# Next Steps:
Creating different models for users and managers/store owners
Restrictiong functionality for different types of users (clock in out for employee, but that is it), the rest should be left for the higher ups
Time logging shift times for employees
Adding specific shift times for different employees
Creating a calender for each individual employee reflecting their shift schedule
Adding an overtime attribute for employees and associated modified compensation per hour
Keeping track of how many hours an employee has worked in a week, year, all time
Functionality for employer users to leave notes about any specific employee for hiring/firing reference
Design according to a specific ORIGINAL COMPANY, i.e. taking out walmart references, inserting my own
Simply making the site more visually appealing. However, not absolutely necessary for an app belonging to this category.
